# Intro

Coexistence is everywhere (coral reefs, tropical forests, grasslands, gut microbiota, etc.) and should be simple to obtain.

Coexistence is supposed to be _stable_ in these communities [@Clark2003c; @Tilman1982].

Previous theoretical studies have shown that the _stable_ coexistence of a _high number_ of species can be obtained either:

- In heterogeneous environments
- In homogeneous environments, given appropriate trade-offs in species demographic traits [@Tilman1994]. The problem is that such low-dimensional demographic trade-offs have been rarely observed in real communities.
 
Here, we propose a simple theoretical model of community dynamics to show that:

- Stable coexistence is easy to obtain in an heterogeneous environment, assuming each species is the best competitor in a given environment.
- Large intraspecific variability can emerge from (i) environmental variability and (ii) unobserved environmental factors.

Main difference with Adam's model: IV is not explicitly included in the model.

# Model

## Environment

We consider $n_s=w \times h$ sites on a regular grid. Each site $i$ is characterized by a multidimensional environment defined by $n_v$ environmental variables $x_1, \ldots, x_{n_v}$ ($n_v=3$ in our example). Each environmental variable is spatially auto-correlated and derived from an intrinsic conditional autoregressive model (iCAR). Environment variables have values in $[0, 1]$. Environment on a particular site can be defined with a RGB colour. Similar sites (in terms of environment) have similar RGB colours. Environment is not uniformly distributed: some environments are more frequent than others.

## Species

We consider $n_{Sp}$ species indexed on $j$ ($n_{Sp}=64$ in our example). Species niche is multidimensional. Species performance is **optimal** at one point in the multidimensional environmental space. Species performance on each site $p_{ij}$ is computed from the Euclidean distance $d_{ij}$ between the optimal point for species $j$ and the environment on each site $i$, in the multidimensional environmental space: $p_{ij}=-d'_{ij}$, where $d'_{ij}$ is the normalized distance ($d'_{ij}$=$(d_{ij}-\mu_d)/\sigma_d$). This means that one species will outcompete all the other species in one particular environment. Similar species have similar colours.

The number of sites where each species has a higher performance is variable between species. For some species, there is no sites where they would be the most competitive.

## Dynamics

### Initial conditions

Each site is occupied by one individual of one species. Species are drawn at random on each site.

### Mortality

The mortality rate for each individual is a function of the species performance on each site. $\alpha$ is the mean mortality rate and $b$ is the effect of the species performance on the mortality. In our example, we use $\alpha=0.1$ and $b=-0.5$. Mortality leads to vacant sites for which species will compete.

$$\theta_{ij}=\text{logit}^{-1}(\text{logit}(\alpha) + b \times p_{ij})$$

### Recruitment

There is no recruitment limitation (as in @Hurtt1995) in our model. We assume that each species which is **still** present in the community has the ability to send a propagule on each vacant site. The species with the highest performance on each site outcompetes the other species and occupies the site.

## Simulations

- Number of generations: $g=100$.
- Number of repetitions with changing initial conditions: $r=10$.

# Result

## Species coexistence

Species without suitable environment are excluded from the community. Stable coexistence of the other species.

![](outputs/m0/species_richness_with_time.png){width="100%"}

The mean species rank (over repetitions) at the end of the simulations is correlated to the frequency of suitable habitat for the species.

## Environmental filtering

Species end up occupying the sites where they have the highest performance. Community is structured in space and follows the spatial structure of the environment.

![](outputs/m0/sp_autocorrelation.png){width="100%"}

There is a decrease of the mean mortality rate with time associated to an increase of the mean species performance over all sites.

## Intraspecific variability

### Niche shape

Intraspecific variability emerges from the environmental variation in space: individuals perform differently depending on the environment. For example, we can plot the relationship between species performance and the first environmental variable $x_1$, and fit a polynomial model $p_{ij}=\beta_{0,j}+\beta_{1,j} x_{1,i}+\beta_{2,j} x_{1,i}^2 + \varepsilon_{ij}$, $\varepsilon_{ij} \sim Normal(0, V_j)$. We obtain the classical relationships: bell shape, increasing, or decreasing relationship, depending on the position of the species on the environmental axis. **Note**: this relationship (showing intraspecific variability) can also be observed if the environment is unidimensional.

### Individual variability

Intraspecific variability $V_j$ emerges from environmental variables $x_2$ and $x_3$ (not considered in the above model). This variability can be structured at the individual scale ("individual variability") when one individual is repeatedly observed at one site.

# Discussion

## Species coexistence and IV

- Two conditions for stable coexistence of species:
  * Variable environmental conditions
  * Each species outperforms the others in a given particular environment
- IV emerges from (i) environmental variability, (ii) unobserved environmental axis
- IV is the result of a _variable_ and _multidimensional_ environment, and is not a mechanism determining species coexistence

## Limitations, thoughts, and perspectives

### Competition for resources

- No competition mechanism _per se_ in the model. We cannot define an intra- or inter-specific competition. Is it a problem?
- Resources are not explicit in the model.
- Coexistence might be too focused on _competition for resources_ (cf. Lotka-Volterra)?
- With such a model, it seems that "competition" between species is important to explain species coexistence (species hierarchy in a given environment), but not the "competition for resources". For example, some species might have a high performance in low-resource environment (eg. shade tolerant species).
- A species is not limited because of high intra-specific competition, but because it cannot dominate in all types of environment (environmental filtering).

### Random thoughts

- No limiting similarity in our model.
- "Each species outperforms the others in a given particular environment": how does it translate exactly in real ecosystems? In terms of growth, mortality, fecundity?
- Add recruitment limitation (no recruitment limitation = strong hypothesis).
